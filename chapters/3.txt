*ELEISE*
Looks full, any reason why? 

MICAH looks at the bottle in slight annoyance. 

MICAH 
What difference does it make, I've ran through so many already they at best give me 3 hours 4 if I'm lucky. 

ELEISE 
Some is better than none. 

She shakes out two pills, takes MICAHS hand and places then in it. 

ELEISE 
Its not a permanent fix you and I both know that but, at least take them. For your sake if not mine. 

MICAH hold the pills his face is a mixture of emotions. He tossed the pills into his mouth, grimaces, and and sighs. 

ELEISE 
I'm not sure if I should be impressed or worried how easily you did that. 

MICAH scoffs and falls back to the bed, he turns facing away from ELEISE.

MICAH
Both. 

SCENE END 

EXT. CILORUS CITY - MORNING

A large overhead of a city showcasing hundreds of skyscrapers and building. People are walking, all wearing different attire. There is an abundance of noise from car, buses, people, and trains. There is overhead noise from speakers and large LED screens showing the morning news in serval screens and ads. 

REPORTOR 1
O.S 
You can expect another sunny day here in Cilorus. No clouds or abnormal weather in our sights. Great if you just want to be outside and enjoy the fresh city air. 

REPORTOR 2
O.S 
(laughing) 
Sounds great! I think I'll take the time to get outside the news room myself for once. 

REPORTOR 1 
I agree, it's stuffy in there, huh? Well if you do decide to come outside don't be too surprised by some sudden dome interference. There's a routine clean up in our sky's today as well but nothing too intense. 

MICAH hands are tucked in his jacket pockets. He walks, in a traditional school uniform. All white, with blue trimmings on the sleeves and collar. He wears a backpack, and street shoes. His pace is quick as he makes it down the city side walk. He stops at a cross walk. 

An unknown, medium space craft, hits the sky shield above. 

CLANG, followed but a deep, resonating HUMMM as the shelf absorbs the impact and ripples with energy. 

Some passer-byers look surprised, others disinterested as the cross light turned white. MICAH walks with them indifferent to the event above him. 

EXT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING 

He picks up his pace and head up a train platform that is nearly crowded with people. Overhead LED signs show train times and routes. 

CONDUCTOR 
(Pleasantly, and clearly)
There is a train approaching the platform, please stand away from the edge. 

The train arrives at the station, it's sleek, white, and filled partially with passenger. MICAH makes his way through people as he boards the train. 

INT. TRAIN - DAY

A mild look of excited on MICAHS face as he finds an open seat. The train doors close with a soft shut and the train takes off. 

MUSIC CUE: (Insert any harmonious song with piano)
