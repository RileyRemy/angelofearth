INT. KOH REALM ABANDONED CATHEDRAL - NIGHT 

MICAH lays flat on his back. A cold wind goes by, it brushes his curls. He wakes up blinking slowly, confused. He looks around as he sits up. He swings his legs off the stone pew and stands. 

_MICAH_
(bitterly, muttering)
This dream again.

He walks forward keeping his pace slow. His expression is weary. There is silence. Different scenes of the cathedral shows rumbles on the ground broken pillars, low lights, and overgrown vegetation. 

INT. CATHEDRAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

MICAH is showing signs of being lost. He looks around, and behind him. The hallway from his perspective appears significantly longer than reality. 

BOOM!

MICAH looks up, dirt and pebbles fall from the ceiling.

SCREAMS, SHOUTS, BEGGING FOR HELP

MICAH 
(Fearful, he puffs out a quick breath)
This again…

He hasten his pace to brisk walk, then runs. The VOICES get louder and clearer. 

VOICE 1: PLEASE! PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE ME! 
VOICE 2: IM SO SCARED I DON'T WANT DIE—
VOICE 3: WHY ARE YOU RUNNING HELP US

MICAH run faster, ⅔ of the voices mix together into an ear piercing scream. He nearly falls over trying to cover his ears as he runs. He stops at the end of the hallways to double doors. MICAH is desperate he pushes them, they barely budge. With a shove he slams into the doors, they open. 

INT. KOH MECHAS ROOM - NIGHT 

Silence there is no sound here. 

It is a large space, similar to an enclosed colosseum. Pillars are broken on the ground, some in tack. There is vegetation growing everywhere. Gaps of pillows show a dark space outside. The top of the colosseum is destroyed. The moon peeks through. At it's center is a massive white mecha, it chest has a unique teal gem, same color as a cape on its back, this cape is held to his body by a golden emblem. It is powered off. 

MICAH stands from his place on the ground, he is panting, exhausted. He brushes his hands and hisses. There are wounds from the fall. 

A voice, regal and clear speaks it is a woman. 

EUIONA
For the first time, you've made it into this room. 

MICAH looks forward. His face is in awe of the MECHA. 

EUIONA
I was wondering if you would ever be able to break free of the turmoil going on out there. 

MICAH steps forward. He is perplexed by the Mecha. 

MICAH
What is this thing…

EUIONA
I see you're unable to recognize it yourself. Micah, this is your key, without it your suffering— no mankind's suffering will continue. 

MICAH
(He raises his voice) 
What are you talking about suffering? 

SCREAMS, SHOUTS, BEGGING FOR HELP 

MICAH clutches his ears again. The screams are loud. He is frozen in place. 

EUIONA
A suffering that not even god can relieve you of.

The VOICES are still shrieking they mix in to one. 

MICAH falls to his knees, he is overwhelmed. His eyes squeeze shut. His body is tense prepared for the worse. The ground makes another BOOM. Both walls and pillars fall around him, he flinches fearful as they topple him. 

INT. MICAHS BEDROOM - NIGHT 

MICAH wakes up with a start, he chest is raising rapidly as he lays down. He sits up, and clutches his head. 

A window showcases the night sky outside his bedroom. A city lit up at it's center a massive cathedral nearly touching the moon. 

There is a slight shuffle, his door opens. It's his adoptive mother Elise 40s, tall, brown hair, black eyes, her expression is neutral as she stands. 

MICAH turns to her, a bit surprised. 

ELEISE 
Same dream? I could hear you this time from my room. 
She approaches the bed and sits down 

MICAH
(softly, a bit exasperated) 
Same old same old. I'm starting to think sleeping just isn't something I can do anymore. 

ELEISE 
Never sleeping would be a swift death sentence, you wouldn't last a week. 

She walks over to his dresser, pulls it open and reveals miscellaneous items and pills bottles. She takes one and heads over to MICAH and sits on his bed.
