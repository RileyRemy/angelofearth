      The cold wind whispered through the abandoned cathedral, its icy temperature brushing against Micah’s curls as he lay motionless on the stone floor. His dark brown eyes fluttered open, blinking slowly against the dim light that filtered through the crack in the crumbling walls. Confusion etched itself across his face, his brows furrowing as he pushed himself up, his hands pressing against the cold, uneven stone.

      “This dream again,” he muttered bitterly, his voice low and weary.

      He swung his legs off the stone pew, his movements sluggish, as if the weight of the room was pressing down on his shoulders. Standing, he took a hesitant step forward, his eyes scanning the cathedral. The once-grand hall was now a shadow of its former self - broken pillars lay scattered, their jagged edges catching the faint glow of the moonlight. Overgrown vegetation clawed its way through the cracks, weaving a tapestry of decay. The air was thick with silence, broken only by the occasional creak of shifting stone.

      Micah’s expression was one of exhaustion, his dark circles more pronounced under the pale light. He moved slowly, his footsteps echoing softly as he ventured deeper into the cathedral. The hallway stretched before him, its length distorted seeming to stretch endlessly into the darkness. He glanced over his shoulder, his heart quickening as the walls seemed to close in around him.

      BOOM

      the sound reverberated through the cathedral, shaking the ground beneath his feet. Micah’s head snapped upward, as the dirt and pebbles rained down from the ceiling. His breath hitched, his chest tightening as the scream began

      “PLEASE! PLEASE, SOMEONE SAVE ME!”
